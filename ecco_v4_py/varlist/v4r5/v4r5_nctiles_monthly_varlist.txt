SSH is suitable for comparisons with altimetry sea surface height data products that apply the IB correction. (m)
                  SSHNOIBC          The local height of the sea surface relative to the geoid. SSHNOIBC does not include the inverted barometer (IB) correction, and is suitable for comparisons with altimetry sea surface height data products that do NOT apply the inverse barometer (IB) correction. (m)
                  SSHIBC            The static displacement of the sea surface due to atmosphere pressure loading, known as the inverse barometer (IB) correction. (m)
                  ETAN              Model sea level anomaly, without corrections for global mean density (steric) changes, inverted barometer effect, or volume displacement due to submerged sea-ice and snow. (m)
