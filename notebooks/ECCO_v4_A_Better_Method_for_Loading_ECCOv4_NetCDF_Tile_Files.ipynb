    "# A Better Method for Loading ECCOv4 NetCDF Tile Files\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "Introduce an alternative method for loading ECCO v4 NetCDF tile files that returns `Dataset` and `DataArray` objects with better labelling of variable coordinates with respect to *where* they are situated on the Arakawa-C grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As we showed in the first tutorial, we can use the `open_dataset` method from `xarray` to load a NetCDF tile file into Python as a `Dataset` object.  `open_dataset` is very convienent because it automatically parses the NetCDF file and constructs a `Dataset` object using all of the  dimensions, coordinates, variables, and metadata information.  However, by default the names of the coordinates are pretty generic: *i1*, *i2*, *i3*, etc. We can do a lot better. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the last tutorial we loaded a single ECCOv4 grid tile file and examined its contents.  Let's load it up again and take another look at its coordinates.  This time we'll name the new `Dataset` object  `grid_3_od` since we are loading the file using `open_dataset`."
