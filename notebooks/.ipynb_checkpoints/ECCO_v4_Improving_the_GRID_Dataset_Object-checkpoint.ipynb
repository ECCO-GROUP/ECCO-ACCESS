    "# An Improved Method for Loading ECCOv4 netCDF files\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "To introduce a method for loading data from the ECCO v4 netCDF tile files that returns `Dataset` and `DataArray` objects that properly distinguish *where* on the Arakawa-C grid the variables are situated.\n",
    "\n",
    "This custom routine written for the *ecco_v4_py* package is: `load_tile_from_netcdf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As we showed in the first tutorial, we can use the `xr.open_dataset(data_dir + fname)` routine from xarray to load a netCDF tile file into Python.  This routine parses the netCDF file and extracts the dimensions, coordinates, variables, and metadata information and uses those to construct the `Dataset` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last tutorial we read in a single GRID netCDF tile file and examined its contents. We found that it listed three dimensions, i1, i2, and i3, for its Data variables. Let's load it up again and take a closer look.  This time we'll name the `Dataset` object as `grid_3_default` since we are loading it with the default method from `xarray`."
