The 2D grid parameters only vary with horizontal location and are therefore independent of depth (e.g., **XC** the longitude of the tracer 'c' point).  The 1D grid parameters only vary with depth and are therefore independent of horizontal location (e.g., **RF** the height of a tracer 'c' grid cell).
