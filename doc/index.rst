Welcome to ecco_access!
======================================

*ecco_access* is a Python package with utilities for accessing output from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) state estimate. These tools enable the user to query and download ECCO output to their local machine, or directly access the ECCO output when working in the AWS Cloud.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or would like to contribute to `ecco_access`, please reach out to andrewdelman@ucla.edu. Thank you!
