The ECCO Ocean and Sea-Ice State Estimate
=========================================

What is the ECCO Central Production State Estimate?
---------------------------------------------------

The Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) Central Production state estimate is a reconstruction of the three-dimensional time-varying ocean and sea-ice state.  Currently in Version 4, Release 3 the state estimate covers the period 1992 to 2005 on an approximately 1-degree horizontal grid (cells range from ca. 20 to 110 km in length) and 50 progressively deeper vertical levels.

The ECCO CP state estimate has two defining features: (1) it reproduces a large set of remote sensing and in-situ observational data within their prior quantified uncertainties and (2) the dynamical evolution of its ocean circulation, hydrography, and sea-ice through time perfectly satisfies the laws of physics and thermodynamics.  The state estimate is, in effect, the output of a data-constrained yet free-running simulation of an ocean and sea-ice general circulation model, and consequently can be used to assess budgets of quantities like heat, salt and vorticity.


What are the fields provided by ECCO?
-------------------------------------

The ECCO Central Production Release 3 ocean and sea ice state estimate runs from Jan 1, 1992 to Dec 31, 2015.

Output comes in two geographical projections or layouts:
1. The 13-tile *native* lat-lon-cap 90 (LLC90)
1. 1-degree latitude and longitude 

** why do you need both **

How is the ECCO Central Production State Estimate Made?
-------------------------------------------------------

The ECCO ocean reanalysis system is a mature, state-of-the-art data tool for synthesizing a diverse Earth System observations, including satellite and in-situ data, into a complete and physically-consistent description of Earth’s global ocean and sea-ice state.  Ocean observations, even those from satellites with global coverage, are still sparse in both space and time, relative to the inherent scales of ocean variability.  The ECCO reanalysis system is able to reconstruct the global ocean and sea-ice state by synthesizing hundreds of millions of sparse and heterogeneous ocean and sea-ice satellite and in-situ data with an ocean and sea-ice general circulation model.  Through iterative high-dimension nonlinear optimization using the adjoint of the ocean and sea-ice model the ECCO reanalysis system identifies a particular solution to the system of equations describing ocean and sea-ice dynamics and thermodynamics that reproduces a set of constraining observations in a least-squares sense.

By simultaneously integrating numerous diverse and heterogeneous data streams into the dynamically-consistent framework of the physical model we make optimal use of the data [Munk and Wunsch 1982].  Users of the ECCO reanalysis are not only provided a comprehensive description of the Earth’s changing ocean and sea-ice states but also information about the underlying physical processes responsible for driving those changes.
