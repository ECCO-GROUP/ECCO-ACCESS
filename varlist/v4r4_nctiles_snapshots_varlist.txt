ECCO_L4_SSH_LLC0090GRID_SNAPSHOT_V4R4
                  SSH               Dynamic sea surface height anomaly. Suitable for comparisons with altimetry sea surface height data products that apply the inverse barometer correction. (m)
                  SSHIBC            The inverted barometer correction to sea surface height due to atmospheric pressure loading. (m)
                  SSHNOIBC          Sea surface height anomaly without the inverted barometer correction. Suitable for comparisons with altimetry sea surface height data products that do NOT apply the inverse barometer correction. (m)
                  ETAN              Model sea level anomaly, without corrections for global mean density changes, inverted barometer effect, or volume displacement due to submerged sea-ice and snow. (m)

ECCO_L4_SEA_ICE_CONC_THICKNESS_LLC0090GRID_SNAPSHOT_V4R4
                  SIarea            Sea-ice concentration (fraction between 0 and 1)
                  SIheff            Area-averaged sea-ice thickness (m)
                  SIhsnow           Area-averaged snow thickness (m)
                  sIceLoad          Average sea-ice and snow mass per unit area (kg/m^2)

ECCO_L4_SEA_ICE_VELOCITY_LLC0090GRID_SNAPSHOT_V4R4
                  SIuice            Sea-ice velocity in the model +x direction (m/s)
                  SIvice            Sea-ice velocity in the model +y direction (m/s)

ECCO_L4_OBP_LLC0090GRID_SNAPSHOT_V4R4
                  OBP               Ocean bottom pressure, excluding global mean atmospheric pressure, given as equivalent water thickness. This is suitable for comparisons with GRACE data products. (m)
                  OBPGMAP           Ocean bottom pressure, includes global mean atmospheric pressure, given as equivalent water thickness. This is suitable for comparisons with ocean bottom pressure gauge data products. (m)
                  PHIBOT            Ocean hydrostatic bottom pressure anomaly (m^2/s^2)

ECCO_L4_TEMP_SALINITY_LLC0090GRID_SNAPSHOT_V4R4
                  THETA             Potential temperature, i.e., temperature of water parcel at sea level pressure (degC)
                  SALT              Salinity (1e-3, or parts per thousand)
