original:

"This dataset provides monthly average surface freshwater fluxes interpolated to a regular 0.5-degree grid as one component of a suite of ocean state estimates computed in ECCO Version 4 revision 4. 

""Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean"" (ECCO) is a data assimilating model that produces optimized estimates of ocean state and flux. 

"ECCO Version 4 release 4 (V4r4) constrains a global circulation model (MITgcm^) with diverse datasets that include satellite altimetry products like sea surface height (SSH); data derived from observations of earth’s gravity field like ocean bottom pressure (OBP); observations from diverse in situ sources like Argo, CTD, XBT, ITP, APB, Glider, and TAO mooring temperature and salinity; and numerous other datasets. ECCO V4r4 is the first of the model’s multi-decadal ocean state estimates to cover the Arctic Ocean and provide truly global coverage. It’s also the first to assimilate observations from GRACE (ocean bottom pressure) and Aquarius (sea surface salinity), and the first covering 2016 and 2017. This release represents the 25 year period from 1992 to 2017."

""Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean"" (ECCO) is a data assimilating model that produces optimized estimates of ocean state and flux. 

new:
Ocean state estimates from the ""Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean"" (ECCO) Consortium are dynamically and kinematically-consistent reconstructions of the three-dimensional, time-evolving ocean and sea-ice state. ECCO state estimates.  ECCO V4r4 is a free-running solution of 1-degree global configuration of the MIT general circulation model (MITgcm) that has been fit to observations in a least-squares sense. Ocean and ice data constraints used in V4r4 include sea surface height (SSH) from satellite altimeters [ERS-1/2, TOPEX/Poseidon, GFO, ENVISAT, Jason-1,2,3, CryoSat-2, and SARAL/AltiKa]; sea surface temperature (SST) from satellite radiometers [AVHRR], sea surface salinity (SSS) from the Aquarius satellite radiometer/scatterometer, ocean bottom pressure (OBP) from the GRACE satellite gravimeter; sea ice concentration from satellite radiometers [SSM/I and SSMIS], and in-situ ocean temperature and salinity measured with conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sensors and expendable bathythermographs (XBTs) from several programs [e.g., WOCE, GO-SHIP, Argo, and others] and platforms [e.g.,reserach vessels, gliders, moorings, ice-tethered profilers, and instrumented pinnipeds]. V4r4 covers the period 1992-01-01T12:00:00 to 2018-01-01T00:00:00."
