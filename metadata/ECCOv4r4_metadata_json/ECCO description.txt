"This dataset provides monthly average surface freshwater fluxes interpolated to a regular 0.5-degree grid from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) Version 4 revision 4 (V4r4) ocean and sea-ice state estimate. 

ECCO state estimates are dynamically and kinematically-consistent reconstructions of the three-dimensional, time-evolving ocean, sea-ice, and surface atmospheric state, fluxes, and transports. ECCO V4r4 is a free-running solution of 1-degree global configuration of the MIT general circulation model (MITgcm) that has been fit to observations in a least-squares sense. V4r4 data constraints include sea surface height (SSH) from satellite altimeters [ERS-1/2, TOPEX/Poseidon, GFO, ENVISAT, Jason-1,2,3, CryoSat-2, and SARAL/AltiKa]; sea surface temperature (SST) from satellite radiometers [AVHRR], sea surface salinity (SSS) from the Aquarius satellite radiometer/scatterometer, ocean bottom pressure (OBP) from the GRACE satellite gravimeter; sea ice concentration from satellite radiometers [SSM/I and SSMIS], and in-situ ocean temperature and salinity measured with conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sensors and expendable bathythermographs (XBTs) from several programs [e.g., WOCE, GO-SHIP, Argo, and others] and platforms [e.g.,research vessels, gliders, moorings, ice-tethered profilers, and instrumented pinnipeds]. V4r4 covers the period 1992-01-01T12:00:00 to 2018-01-01T00:00:00."
