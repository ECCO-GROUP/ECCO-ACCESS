    "DATASET.DESCRIPTION": "This dataset provides daily average global mean sea level on the native Lat-Lon-Cap 90 (LLC90) grid used for data assimilation as from the ECCO Version 4 revision 4 (ECCO V4r4) global ocean and sea-ice state estimate. The \"Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean\" (ECCO) Consortium synthesizes ocean and ice observations with state-of-the-art numerical coupled ocean models to produce dynamically and kinematically-consistent reconstructions of the three-dimensional time-evolving ocean state. ECCO V4r4 is a free-running solution of 1-degree global configuration of the MIT general circulation model (MITgcm) that has been fit to observations in a least-squares sense. Ocean and ice data constraints used in V4r4 include sea surface height (SSH) from satellite altimeters [ERS-1/2, TOPEX/Poseidon, GFO, ENVISAT, Jason-1,2,3, CryoSat-2, and SARAL/AltiKa]; sea surface temperature (SST) from satellite radiometers [AVHRR], sea surface salinity (SSS) from the Aquarius satellite radiometer/scatterometer, ocean bottom pressure (OBP) from the GRACE satellite gravimeter; sea ice concentration from satellite radiometers [SSM/I and SSMIS], and in-situ ocean temperature and salinity measured with conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sensors and expendable bathythermographs (XBTs) from several programs [WOCE, GO-SHIP, Argo, and others] and platforms [ships, gliders, moorings, ice-tethered profilers, and instrumented pinnipeds]. V4r4 covers the period 1992-01-01T12:00:00 to 2018-01-01T00:00:00.",
