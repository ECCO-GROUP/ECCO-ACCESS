# # Coordinates and Dimensions of ECCOv4 NetCDF files
# 
# ## Objectives
# 
# Introduce the student ot the idea that the ECCO v4 NetCDF fields have coordinate labels which shows *where* these fields are on the Arakawa-C grid.
# 
# ## Introduction
# 
# The ECCOv4 files are provided as NetCDF files.  The file you have may look a little different than the ones shown here because we have been working hard at improving how what exactly goes into our NetCDF files.  
# 
# This tutorial document is current as of Sep 2019 with the ECCOv4 NetCDF grid files provided in the following directories:
# 
# https://ecco.jpl.nasa.gov/drive/files/Version4/Release3_alt (po.daac drive, recommended)
# 
# https://web.corral.tacc.utexas.edu/OceanProjects/ECCO/ECCOv4/Release3_alt/  (mirror at U. Texas, Austin)
# 
# 
# As we showed in the first tutorial, we can use the `open_dataset` method from `xarray` to load a NetCDF tile file into Python as a `Dataset` object.  `open_dataset` is very convenient because it automatically parses the NetCDF file and constructs a `Dataset` object using all of the  dimensions, coordinates, variables, and metadata information.  
# 
# In the last tutorial we analyzed the contents of a single ECCOv4 file, the 2010 monthly-averaged potential temperature.  Let's load it up again and take a closer look at its coordinates.  This time we'll name the new `Dataset` object *theta_dataset* since we are loading the file using `open_dataset`.

## Import the ecco_v4_py library into Python
## =========================================
## -- If ecco_v4_py is not installed in your local Python library, 
##    tell Python where to find it.  For example, if your ecco_v4_py
##    files are in /Users/ifenty/ECCOv4-py/ecco_v4_py, then use:
sys.path.append('/Users/ifenty/ECCOv4-py')

import ecco_v4_py as ecco


# In[3]:


## Set top-level file directory for the ECCO NetCDF files
## =================================================================
# base_dir = '/home/username/'
base_dir = '/Users/ifenty/ECCOv4-release'

## define a high-level directory for ECCO fields
ECCO_dir = base_dir + '/Release3_alt'


# In[4]:


## LOAD NETCDF FILE
## ================

# directory containing the file
data_dir= ECCO_dir + '/nctiles_monthly/THETA/'

# filename
fname = 'THETA_2010.nc'

# load the file
theta_dataset = xr.open_dataset(data_dir + fname).load()


# Before we get started, plot the temperature field at the surface layer (k=0) for tile 2, NE Atlantic..
# 
# > Note :: Don't worry about the complicated looking code below, w'll cover plotting later

theta_dataset.THETA.isel(k=0,tile=2,time=0).plot(vmin=-2, vmax=25, cmap='jet')


# ## The Dimensions and Coordinates of *THETA*
# 
# Let's take a closer look at what is inside this dataset.  We suppress the metadata (attrs) just to reduce how much is printed to the screen.

# In[6]:


theta_dataset.attrs = []
theta_dataset


# ### Dimensions
# 
# *theta_dataset* shows six dimensions, **i**, **j**, **k**, **tile**, **time**, and **nv**.  Recall that ``Dataset`` objects are containers and so it lists all of the  **unique** dimensions of the variables it is storing.  *theta_dataset* is storing a single *Data variable*, *THETA*.  We see that this *THETA* field is five dimensional from the (**tile**, **time**, **k**, **j**, **i**) in the line:
# ~~~
# THETA      (time, tile, k, j, i) float32 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 ... 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
# ~~~
# Examining the coordinates of the ``Dataset``, we find that all of them have some combination of the six dimensions.  Note **nv** is not a spatial or temporal dimension per se. It is a kind of dummy dimension of length 2 for the coordiante **time_bnds** which has both a starting and ending time for each one averaging period.  

# ### Coordinates
# 
# #### Dimension Coordinates
# 
# Beyond having three spatial dimensions *theta_dataset* also has *coordinates* in the **i**, **j**, and **k** directions.  The most basic coordinates are 1D vectors, one for each dimension, which contain *indices* for the array.  Let us call these basic coordinates, *dimension coordinates*.  Here we use 0 as the first index of dimension coordinates
# ```
#   * j          (j) int32 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ... 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89
#   * i          (i) int32 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ... 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89
#   * k          (k) int32 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ... 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49
#   * tile       (tile) int32 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
#   * time       (time) datetime64[ns] 2010-01-16T12:00:00 ... 2010-12-16T12:00:00
# ```
# 
# Let's examine each *Dimension Coordinate* more closely
# 
# ##### Dimension Coordinate ``i``

# In[7]:


theta_dataset.i


# *i* is an array of integers from 0 to 89 indicating the *x_grid_index* along this tile's *X* axis.

# ##### Dimension Coordinate ``j``

# In[8]:


theta_dataset.j


# *j* is an array of integers from 0 to 89 indicating the *y_grid_index* along this tile's *Y* axis.
# 
# ##### Dimension Coordinate ``k``

# In[9]:


theta_dataset.k


# *k* is an array of integers from 0 to 49 indicating the *z_grid_index* along this tile's *Z* axis.
# 
# ##### Dimension Coordinate ``tile``

# In[10]:


theta_dataset.tile


# *tile* is an array of integers from 0 to 12, one for each tile of the lat-lon-cap grid.
# 
# ##### Dimension Coordinate ``time``

# In[11]:


theta_dataset.time


# In this file the *time* coordinate indicates the *center time of the averaging period*.  Recall that we loaded the monthly-mean ``THETA`` fields for  2010, so the *center time of the averaging periods* are the middle of each month in 2010.
# 
# #### Other Coordinates
# 
# Notice some *coordinates* do not have an **"\*"** in front of their names:
# ```             
# Coordinates:
#     Z          (k) float32 -5.0 -15.0 -25.0 -35.0 ... -5039.25 -5461.25 -5906.25
#     PHrefC     (k) float32 49.05 147.15 245.25 ... 49435.043 53574.863 57940.312
#     drF        (k) float32 10.0 10.0 10.0 10.0 10.0 ... 387.5 410.5 433.5 456.5
#     XC         (tile, j, i) float32 -111.60647 -111.303 ... -111.86579
#     YC         (tile, j, i) float32 -88.24259 -88.382515 ... -88.07871 -88.10267
#     rA         (tile, j, i) float32 362256450.0 363300960.0 ... 361119100.0
#     hFacC      (tile, k, j, i) float32 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 ... 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
#     time_bnds  (time, nv) datetime64[ns] 2010-01-01 2010-02-01 ... 2011-01-01
#     iter       (time) int32 158532 159204 159948 160668 ... 165084 165804 166548
# ```
# 
# These are so-called [non-dimension coordinates](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/data-structures.html#coordinates).  From the xarray documenation:
# 
# ```
# 1. non-dimension coordinates are variables that [may] contain coordinate data, 
#    but are not a dimension coordinate. 
# 
# 2. They can be multidimensional ... and there is no relationship between 
#    the name of a non-dimension coordinate and the name(s) of its dimension(s). 
# 
# 3. Non-dimension coordinates can be useful for indexing or plotting; ...
# ```
# 
# Four of these variables contain spatial coordinate data:
# 
# * **XC** and **YC**, the longitude and latitudes of the 'c' points (varies with **tile**, **j** and **i**)
# * **Z** the center depth of tracer cells (varies only with **k**)
# * **PHrefC**, a reference pressure of tracer cells (varies only with **k**)
# 
# Two of these variables have *spatial dimensions* but are not coordinates in a traditional sense (and they will be removed in future ECCOv4 releases because their presence here makes no sense).
# 
# * **hFacC**, the fraction (0,1) of a tracer grid cell height which is wet (varies with **tile**, **k**, **j**, and **i**) 
# * **drF**, the distance between the top and bottom of a tracer grid cell (varies only with **k**)
# * **rA**, model grid cell area (varies with **tile**, **j** and **i**)
# 
# Three non-dimension coordinates do not have any spatial dimensions!  
# 
# * **iter**, the time step of the model (time iteration) when the record was saved 
# * **time**, a calendar date and time 
# * **time_bnds**, a 1x2 array of calendar dates and times indicating the start and end times of the averaging period of the field
# 
# When multiple DataArrays from different tiles and times are combined, the dimensions of the merged arrays will expand along the **time** and **tile** dimensions.   
# 
# Let's quickly look at the **time_bnds** coordinate:

# In[12]:


theta_dataset.time_bnds


# For time-averaged fields, **time_bnds** is a 2D array provding the *start* and *end* time of each averaging period.  
# 
# Let's look at the third record (March, 2010)

# In[13]:


theta_dataset.time_bnds[2]


# We see that the time bounds are 2010-03-10 to 2010-04-01, which make sense.
#   
# Having this time-bounds information readily available can be very helpful.

# ## The Dimension Coordinates of the Arakawa C-Grid

# Dimension coordinates have special meanings.  The MITgcm uses the staggered Arakawa-C grid (hereafter c-grid). In c-grid models, variables are staggered in space.  Horizontally, variables are associated with three 'locations': 
# 
# 1. tracer cells (e.g. temperature, salinity, density)
# 2. the 4 lateral faces of tracer cells (e.g., horizontal velocities and fluxes) 
# 3. the 4 corners of tracer cells (e.g., vertical component of vorticity field)
# 
# Vertically, there are also two 'locations': 
# 
# 1. tracer cells
# 2. the 2 top/bottom faces of tracer cells (e.g., vertical velocities and fluxes).
# 
# To understand this better, let's review the geometry of c-grid models.
# 
# ### 3D staggering of velocity components. 
# 
# Paraphrasing from https://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/algorithm/c-grid.html,
# 
# ~~~
# In c-grid models, the components of flow (ùë¢,ùë£,ùë§) are staggered in 
# space such that the zonal component falls on the interface between 
# tracer cells in the zonal direction. Similarly for the meridional 
# and vertical directions. 
# ~~~
# 
# #### Why the c-grid?
# 
# ~~~
# The basic algorithm employed for stepping forward the momentum 
# equations is based on retaining non-divergence of the flow at 
# all times. This is most naturally done if the components of flow
# are staggered in space in the form of an Arakawa C grid...
# ~~~
# 
# ![uvw-grid](../figures/uvw.png )
# 
# 
# ### Defining the c-grid coordinate system
# 
# As shown, variables on Arakawa-C grids (c-grid) are staggered in space.  For convenience we  define a coordinate system that distinguishes between these different locations.
# 
# #### The c-grid horizontal coordinates
# 
# In the horizontal, variables can take one of four locations: **c**, **u**, **v**, or **g**.  
# 
# ![c-grid](../figures/C-grid-points.png )
# 
# 
# ##### horizontal "c" location
# 
# Variables associated with tracer cell area or volumetric averages (e.g., temperature, salinity, sea ice thickness, air-sea net heat flux) and variables associated with vertical velocities (e.g., $\vec w$) are identified with **c** locations.
# 
# For these variables we define the horizontal dimensions of **i** and **j**, corresponding with the model grid $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively.  
# 
# ##### horizontal "u" location
# 
# Variables associated with the two lateral sides of tracer cells in the $x$ direction are identified with **u** locations. 
# 
# Define the horizontal dimensions of **u** variables as **i_g** and **j**, corresponding with the model's $x$ and $y$ dimensions, respectively.  
# 
# > **Important Note**: In the llc90 curvilinear model grid used by ECCOv4, the $x$ direction is **NOT** same as the geographic zonal (east-west) direction.
# 
# ##### horizontal "v" location
# 
# Variables associated with the two lateral sides of tracer cells in the $y$ direction are identified with **v** locations. 
# 
# Define the horizontal dimensions of **v** variables as **i** and **j_g**, corresponding with the model's $x$ and $y$ dimensions, respectively.
# 
# > **Important Note**: In the llc90 curvilinear model grid used by ECCOv4, the $y$ direction is **NOT** same as the geographic meridional (north-south) direction.
# 
# 
# ##### horizontal "g" location
# 
# Variables associated with the horizontal corners of tracer grid cells are identified with **g** locations.
# 
# Define the horizontal dimensions of **g** variables as **i_g** and **j_g**, corresponding with the model's $x$ and $y$ dimensions, respectively.  
# 
# #### The c-grid vertical coordinates
# 
# In the horizontal, variables can take one of two locations: **c** and **w**
# 
# #### vertical "c" location
# 
# Variables associated with tracer cell volumetric quantities (e.g., temperature, salinity) are identified with **c** locations.
# 
# For these variables we define the vertical dimensions of **k** which corresponds with the model grid' $z$ direction.
# 
# #### vertical "w" location
# 
# Variables associated with the two top/bottom sides of tracer cells in the $z$ direction are identified with **w** locations. 
# 
# For these variables we define the vertical dimension of **$k_u$** to indicate the model tracer cell's **u**pper faces in the $k$ direction, respectively.  
# 
# Two other vertical dimensions are also used.  **$k_l$** indicates the model tracer cell's **l**ower faces, and $k_{p1}$ which index all of the **upper** and **lower** faces.  
# 
# > Note: In ECCOv4 NetCDF files both **$k_u$**(0) and **$k_{p1}$**(0) correspond to the same top face of the model tracer grid cell.

# ## All ECCOv4 coordinates
# 
# Now that we have been oriented to the dimensions and coordinates used by ECCOv4, let's load up and examinea a ``Dataset`` that uses all of them, an ECCOv4 NetCDF grid file. 
# 
# Open the ECCOv4 grid file associated with tile 2:

# In[14]:


grid_dir = ECCO_dir + '/nctiles_grid/'
print(grid_dir)
## load the grid
grid_dataset = xr.open_dataset(grid_dir + 'ECCOv4r3_grid.nc')

# show contents of grid_dataset

# ### Dimensions
# `Dimensions:  (i: 90, i_g: 90, j: 90, j_g: 90, k: 50, k_l: 50, k_p1: 51, k_u: 50, tile: 13)`
# 
# The *Dimensions* list now lists the six different coordinates and their dimension used by variables stored in this new grid tile `Dataset` object.

# These ancilliary fields are classified as non-dimension coordinates because we wanted to reserve *data variables* for variables that are part of the model solution.
# 
# In the end, it doesn't matter what you call these ancillary variables -- what matters is that you have them on hand for calculations.  If it makes you feel beter, use the function ``.reset_coords()`` to convert all non-dimension coordinates to data variables.

# 
# ### Model Grid Geometry Fields 
# 
# Let's examine one of these grid geometric variables, *dxG*:

# In[15]:


grid_dataset.dxG


# ``dxG`` has coordinates **tile**, **j_g** and **i** which means that it is a **v** location variable.  ``dxG`` is the horizontal distance between $g$ points (tracer cell corners) in the tile's $x$ direction.  
# 
# For reference, see the chart below from the MITgcm documentation, [Figure 2.6](https://mitgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/algorithm/horiz-grid.html "Fig 2.6")
# 
# dxG = $\Delta x_g$ in subfigure (a) below:

The grid lines indicate the tracer cell boundaries and are the reference grid for all panels. a) The area of a tracer cell, ùê¥ùëê, is bordered by the lengths Œîùë•ùëî and Œîùë¶ùëî. b) The area of a vorticity cell, ùê¥ùúÅ, is bordered by the lengths Œîùë•ùëê and Œîùë¶ùëê. c) The area of a u cell, ùê¥ùë§, is bordered by the lengths Œîùë•ùë£ and Œîùë¶ùëì. d) The area of a v cell, ùê¥ùë†, is bordered by the lengths Œîùë•ùëì and Œîùë¶ùë¢.*

# ## Dimensions and Coordinates of *UVEL*
# 
# So far we looked *THETA* which is a $c$ variable.  Let's examine *UVEL*, horizontal velocity in the tile's $x$ direction.  As you've probably guessed, *UVEL* is a $u$ variable: 
# 
# Load tile 2 of the 2010 March average horizonatal velocity in the $x$ direction.

# In[16]:


# Directory of the UVEL files
data_dir= ECCO_dir + '/nctiles_monthly//UVEL/'

fname = 'UVEL_2010.nc'
uvel_dataset = xr.open_dataset(data_dir + fname).load()
uvel_dataset.attrs = []


# ### ``UVEL`` context
# 
# Plot tile 1 time-mean horizontal velocity at the top-most model grid cell in the tile's $x$ direction

# In[17]:


fig=plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6.5))
ud_masked = uvel_dataset.UVEL.where(uvel_dataset.hFacW > 0, np.nan)
ud_masked.isel(k=0,tile=1, time=0).plot(cmap='jet', vmin=-.2,vmax=.2)


# Let's look at the dimensions and coordinates of *UVEL*

# In[18]:


uvel_dataset.data_vars


# In[19]:


uvel_dataset.coords


# ### Dimension coordinates
# 
# As expected, ``UVEL`` has horizontal dimensions of **i_g, j**. Because ``UVEL`` is the velocity at the left and right faces of 3D tracer cells.

# ## Dimensions and Coordinates of *VVEL*
# 
# Finally, let's examine *VVEL*, horizontal velocity in the tile's $y$ direction.  As you've probably guessed, *VVEL* is a $v$ variable: 

# In[20]:


# Directory of the VVEL files
data_dir= ECCO_dir + '/nctiles_monthly//VVEL/'

fname = 'VVEL_2010.nc'
vvel_dataset = xr.open_dataset(data_dir + fname).load()
vvel_dataset.attrs = []


# ### ``VVEL`` context
# 
# Plot the time-mean horizontal velocity in the tile's $y$ direction at model level 5 (55m) 

# In[21]:


fig=plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6.5))
vd_masked = vvel_dataset.VVEL.where(vvel_dataset.hFacS > 0, np.nan)
vd_masked.isel(k=0,tile=1, time=0).plot(cmap='jet', vmin=-.2,vmax=.2)


# In[22]:


vvel_dataset.data_vars


# In[23]:


vvel_dataset.coords


# ### Dimension coordinates
# 
# As expected, *VVEL* has horizontal dimensions of **i, j_g**. Because *VVEL* is the velocity at the front and rear faces of 3D tracer cells we use **k** for its vertical coordinate.

# ## Summary
# 
# ECCOv4 variables are on the staggered Arakawa-C grid.  Different dimension labels and coordinates are applied to state estimate variables so that one can easily identify where on the c-grid any particular variable is situated.
